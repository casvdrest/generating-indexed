# Generating Constrained Test Data using Datatype Generic Programming

This repository contains all the deliverables accompanying my Master's thesis: 
[Generating Constrained Test Data using Datatype Generic Programming](https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/383386). 

The repository contains the following elements:

*   `/Defense` the slides used during the thesis defense 
*   `/Implementation` implementation in Haskell of the generic enumerator for indexed descriptions 
*   `/Model` Agda model describing generic enumerators for various type universes, together with 
    proofs of their completeness. 
*   `/TyDe` the slides used during [TyDe '19](https://icfp19.sigplan.org/home/tyde-2019)
*   `/Writup` TeX files for the thesis, TyDe '19 extended abstract, ICFP '19 SRC extended abstract and project proposal
